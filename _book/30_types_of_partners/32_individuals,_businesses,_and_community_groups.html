<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We think we can train ourselves to be anything and oftentimes miss the point: brilliant people are coming into our buildings every day.&quot;<br>-- Chrystie Hill, Merrilee Proffitt, and Sharon Streams in <a href="http://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/IMLS_Focus_Learning_in_Libraries_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><em>IMLS Focus: Learning in Libraries</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private individuals, local businesses, and community groups that are not oriented towards youth or social services may not be obvious potential partners, but they are rich and often untapped assets for a library&#x2019;s teen services. These types of partnerships are some of the most valuable for providing professional expertise in a variety of areas that teens might be interested in, thus extending the capacity of the library&#x2019;s youth services without requiring extensive staff training or new hires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The library is considered not only a foundation to the community, but a good community supporter. We say, &quot;How can the library partner with you?&quot; And it brings them in and they want to work here, and they want to work with teens, and they want to give back... We&apos;re getting a lot of community people who want to come in. They want to help, and they want to see our teens succeed.&quot;<br>-- Southern Urban Library</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Materials and equipment</strong><br>Businesses can easily contribute by providing access to equipment that the library doesn&#x2019;t own, demoing or loaning products like gaming consoles or 3D printers.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup> They can donate craft materials, prizes, or even snacks &#x2014; for instance, a game store could donate prizes for video game tournaments, and a cinema or grocery store could donate popcorn for movie night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Community Groups</strong><br>Reach out to community groups like Rotary as well as topical organizations or businesses (astronomy clubs, humanities councils, art studios, etc.) to find individuals who would be willing to volunteer their time to work with youth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Parents and family members</strong><br>Parents and family members of teens who are already regular library users already know something about what the library does and what you have to offer teens. They can be valuable resources, either as volunteers themselves or as connections to businesses or community groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Exchanging expertise</strong><br>Library staff can provide expertise that the partnering group doesn&#x2019;t have, and vice versa. For instance, a community MakerSpace can help repair a library&#x2019;s broken 3D printer, while the library staff can help Makers with grant writing.</td>

<td><strong>Inexperience with Teens</strong><br>The individual you&#x2019;re working with may not have experience working with youth.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5 id="adult-volunteers-at-a-rural-midwestern-library">ADULT VOLUNTEERS AT A RURAL MIDWESTERN LIBRARY</h5></span>
Adult community members are a rich source of expertise for many libraries. Library staff we interviewed spoke highly of their many adult volunteers who work with teens. They used personal connections and relationships to recruit both adult and teen volunteers: <b>&#x201C;I try my best to remember everybody&apos;s name&#x2026; I build this relationship with every single person that I come in contact with and the next thing you know, they lead me to another person, they lead me to another thing and then we just have so many different partnerships right now. It&apos;s awesome. And because we have so much good families, good sentiment where everybody&apos;s pitching in, we can do so much more.&#x201D;</b><p></p><p>One of the biggest benefits to come from this relationship building was the expertise of a retired electrical engineer who was working with the local high school&#x2019;s computer club. <b>&#x201C;Somebody mentioned to us that he&apos;d be interested in helping you with the Lego robotics because he likes anything techy and he likes to work with older kids.&quot;</b> The librarian invited him to volunteer at the library as well, and he now runs weekly Lego robotics workshops when he&#x2019;s not enjoying retirement by traveling. The librarian helps by managing the teens. <b>&#x201C;He kind of shies away from managing the kids and trying to keep their focus, but he does have the technical know how. So, between both of us, we&apos;re able to keep the kids somewhat engaged.&#x201D;</b></p></div>
